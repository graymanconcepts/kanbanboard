I understand you want a fully-featured Kanban board with both column and task sorting capabilities. I've already implemented this functionality in the provided code using `@dnd-kit` for smooth drag and drop interactions. Let me explain the key features:

1. **Drag and Drop Tasks**:
    
    - Tasks can be reordered within the same column
    - Tasks can be moved between columns
    - Smooth animations during dragging with no "bounce back" effect
    - Visual feedback during drag operations
2. **Sortable Columns**:
    
    - Entire columns can be reordered
    - Columns maintain their tasks when moved
    - Visual placeholder during column dragging
3. **Task Editing**:
    
    - Click the edit icon (pencil) to modify task content
    - Modal dialog for editing
    - Smooth save/cancel operations
4. **API Integration**:
    
    - Data is fetched from a simulated API endpoint
    - All changes are persisted through API calls
    - Loading states and error handling included
5. **Visual Features**:
    
    - Color-coded column headers
    - Smooth animations and transitions
    - Responsive design
    - Loading spinner during initial data fetch

The code is already set up and ready to run. You can start the development server to see it in action:

Start Kanban Board

- Start application
    
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    

Try these interactions:

1. Drag tasks within a column to reorder them
2. Drag tasks between columns
3. Drag columns to reorder them
4. Click the edit icon on any task to modify its content

1. **New Ticket Creation**:
    
    - Added a "Create Ticket" button in the header
    - Modal form with fields for title, description, assignee, and due date
    - New tickets are automatically added to the "New Tickets" column
2. **Enhanced Task Cards**:
    
    - Title and description
    - Assignee with avatar
    - Due date with calendar icon
    - Open/Close status toggle
    - Edit functionality
3. **Task Status Management**:
    
    - Toggle between open/closed states
    - Closed tasks are visually dimmed with strikethrough title
    - Status persists across columns
4. **Column Organization**:
    
    - Added "New Tickets" column as the initial bucket
    - Maintained existing column structure
    - All columns remain draggable
5. **Smooth Animations**:
    
    - Improved drag and drop transitions
    - No bouncing when moving cards
    - Smooth opacity transitions for status changes


The Kanban board implementation with a comprehensive ticket management system uses modern React practices, TypeScript for type safety, and Tailwind CSS for styling. All drag and drop operations are smooth with no "bounce back" effect, and the data is properly maintained through simulated API calls.
